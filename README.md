# üöÄ Introduction

<p align="justify">
This project represents the technical challenge stage of Siemens' selection process and the following document describes the logic designed for each question. The following topics are available:
</p>

1. [Programming Language](#language)
2. [Project organization](#organize)
3. [Challenge Responses](#questions)

<div id='language' />

# üîß Programming Language

<p align="justify">
As I have already carried out projects with this language, I chose <strong><i>Java</i></strong> as the programming language to solve the practical exercises.
</p>

<div id='organize' />

# üìÅ Project organization

<p align="justify">
The organization of the project is very simple, the <strong><i>scripts</i></strong> folder contains questions six, eight and nine, which are SQL files or .txt commands (as is the case with question nine). 
 The <strong><i>src</i></strong> contais questions three, four, ten, eleven and the Main file.
</p>

1. [The Script Folder](#script)
2. [The Src Folder](#src)

<div id='script' />

## üìÅ The Script Folder

<p align="justify">
This folder separates the challenges that are in SQL and those that are arranged in files in .txt format.

<div id='src' />

## üìÅ The Src Folder

<p align="justify">
For the challenges made in Java, I created a class for each one and they are present in their respective folders. In the Main class, I created a menu to organize the separation of each exercise.

## üí° Question Three

<p align="justify">
This code is an implementation of a Java program that loops through numbers from 1 to 100 and prints "Foo" if the number is a multiple of 3, "Baa" if it is a multiple of 5, and "FooBaa" if it is a multiple of both. If it is not a multiple of either, it simply prints the number. Let's see step by step.</p>

<p align="justify">
This is a private method that checks if number is a multiple of multiple. It returns true if it is and false otherwise. The % operator is used to calculate the remainder of dividing number by multiple, and if the remainder is zero, then number is a multiple of multiple.</p>

<p align="justify">
This method loops through the numbers 1 to 100 using a for loop. For each number, it calls the multipleValidator method to check if it is a multiple of 3 and/or 5. Depending on the result, it concatenates the strings "Foo" and/or "Baa" to the resp variable. If the resp variable is still empty after the checks, it means that the number is not a multiple of 3 or 5, so the number itself is concatenated to resp. At the end of each iteration, the string resp is printed to the console.</p>

<div id='4' />

## üí° Question Four

<p align="justify">
This code implements a function called ConcatRemove that receives two strings s and t, and an integer k. The function returns "yes" if it is possible to transform the string s into the string t in at most k operations, where an operation consists of removing a character from the end of a string or adding a character to the end of a string. Otherwise, returns "no". Let's see step by step.</p>

<p align="justify">
The CountCharactersInTheSamePosition method is a helper method that counts the number of characters in the same positions in s and t, stopping the count when it encounters the first different character.

* countSameCharacter: Calculates the number of equal characters in the corresponding positions of the strings s and t. These characters are the ones at the beginning and remain unchanged during operations.
 
* totalOperations: Calculates the total number of operations required to transform string s into string t. This is the sum of the non-matching characters in s and t after the matching positions.
 
* isKWithinValidTotalOperations: Checks whether the value of k is sufficient to perform the total number of necessary operations, and whether the difference (k - totalOperations) is an even number.
 
* isKWithinTotalLength: Checks if k is greater than or equal to the total length of the strings s and t.
  
* The code finally decides whether it is possible to transform s to t in at most k operations and returns "yes" or "no" according to the conditions mentioned above.
