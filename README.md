# 🔧 Programming Language

<p align="justify">
As I have already carried out projects with this language, I chose <strong><i>Java</i></strong> as the programming language to solve the practical exercises.

<div id='organize' />

# 📁 Project organization

<p align="justify">
The organization of the project is very simple, the <strong><i>scripts</i></strong> folder contains questions six, eight and nine, which are SQL files or .txt commands (as is the case with question nine). 
 The <strong><i>src</i></strong> contais questions three, four, ten, eleven and the Main file.

## 📁 The Script Folder

<p align="justify">
This folder separates the challenges that are in SQL and those that are arranged in files in .txt format.

<div id='src' />

## 📁 The Src Folder

<p align="justify">
For the challenges made in Java, I created a class for each one and they are present in their respective folders. In the Main class, I created a menu to organize the separation of each exercise.
